Bifröst is a easy-to-use self-host VPN proxy solution for all your remote assistant needs.

Define VPN connections to other organizations and create RDP (and other) connections through them, without the need of a local VPN client.

# ✔️ Prerequisites

You need a local Kubernetes Cluster - this container will deploy pods containing the relevant VPN client.

> Tested on Ubuntu Core 22.04 with k8s v1.27.3
